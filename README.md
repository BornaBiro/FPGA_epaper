# FPGA_epaper
 FPGA code/implementation for driving epaper with ULX3S board.

This FPGA implementation is still under heavy development, so use it only for educational purposes!
It only can refresh / clean ED060SC7 panel. For epaper power supply, Inkplate board is being used.
The used software is Lattice Diamond 3.12.0.240.2 with Synplify Pro Synthesis Engine (for some reason PLL did not work on Lattice LSE).
