@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT529 :"e:\projects\fpga\learning\epaper\clocks.v":7:1:7:6|Found inferred clock pll|CLKOP_inferred_clock which controls 1 sequential elements including clckDiv.out. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
