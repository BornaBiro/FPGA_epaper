@W: MT531 :"e:\projects\fpga\learning\epaper\epaperdriver.v":91:3:91:4|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 10 sequential elements including myCtrlModule.frame[9].  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"e:\projects\fpga\learning\epaper\clocks.v":7:1:7:6|Found inferred clock pll|CLKOP_inferred_clock which controls 5 sequential elements including clckDiv.counter[3:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
